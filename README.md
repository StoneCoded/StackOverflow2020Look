## 1. Installation.

Beyond the standard Anaconda distribution of Python 3, there should be no issues running the code.

## 2. Motivation

For various reasons I have found myself at a junction in my life. With a background in engineering but no suitable jobs for my field I am turning towards Data Science but at the ripe age of 28 I am feeling like I may be a bit late to the game. As I want to make a serious go at this I want to know the scale of the hill I must climb so putting to bed some of these insecurities may help motivate me in the short term whilst also helping me practise my analytical skills. So I want to find out 3 things:

1. Am I too old?
2. Am I underqualified?
3. Will I actually get a job at the end?

As long as the answer for any of these isn't too devastating it will only bolster my enthusiasm. 

## 3. File Descriptions
